## Who We Are

We are a small, international [team](http://www.grobmeier.de) who love Dart.

The Dartlang webpages are great, but it cannot link to all the interesting
sources which are available. Dartosphere fills this gap, and works towards
becoming a portal to the all what's around Dart. 

And if you already noticed, we still have JavaScript running here. We are sorry, and are working on that.

Thanks for visiting the Dartosphere and enjoy you trip!

If you have any more questions, please [get in touch](/imprint.html).
