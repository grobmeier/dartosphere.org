## Who we are

We are a small, international team who created the Dartosphere.
The Dartosphere is maintained by [Christian Grobmeier](http://www.grobmeier.de).

The Dartlang webpages are already full of great information. 
The Dartosphere tries to collect information brought by the wider community
and to serve as a resource for knowledge which can't be easily stored
on a website like dartlang.org.

We have done this for passion for the past years. We plan to cover
server costs and work time in near future with allowing good looking,
relevant ads from companies. These ads must not annoy and will 
be relevant to you, our readers.

That aside, we just have fun watching Dart grow.

And if you already recognized, we still have JavaScript running here -
we are sorry, and we are working on that. Step by step.

Thanks for visiting the Dartosphere and enjoy you trip!
