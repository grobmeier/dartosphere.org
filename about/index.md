## Who we are

We are a small, international [team](http://www.grobmeier.de) who love Dart.

The Dartlang webpages are great, but it cannot link to all the interesting
sources which are available. Dartosphere fills this gap, and works towards
becoming a portal to the all what's around Dart. 

You might have already recognized that we still use JavaScript.
We treat this as a bug and welcome your patches.

Thanks for visiting the Dartosphere and enjoy you trip!

If you have any more questions, please [get in touch](imprint.html).
