<p>Building web applications is hard. Building <em><strong>large</strong></em> web applications is a real challenge. Given this, I am super
excited by the emergence of Dart as a structured web programming language for building applications for the modern web.</p>

<p>I am mostly a Ruby and Python hacker. I have spent the last few years doing web programming and this means that I
have spent a lot of time writing Javascript. I <em>really</em> like coding in Javascript: I like its (mostly) coherent OO/functional
hybrid syntax, I find it expressive and I like to make use of its rich and rapidly evolving ecosystem of frameworks and libraries.</p>

<p>Javascript started off as small language for animating mostly static web pages. As the
web has evolved, Javascript code-bases have become larger (my last project, a Rails 3 app using Backbone, had more Javascript than
Ruby code in it). Large codebases require careful use of code reuse and organization if they are to scale; through the use of &#8216;classes&#8217; and inheritance,
the module and sandbox design patterns, popular MVC frameworks like Backbone and Angular, Javascript developers have sought to bring
more structure to their code.</p>

<p>I very much view Dart as a logical next step in this quest for greater code organization. The Dart project is a serious - and long awaited -
attempt at creating an alternative to writing web applications using Javascript; it is likely to appeal to those who want to
retain the relative ease of current web development, but want a language with more structure than what is available to them today.
Building large web applications has been quite daunting - even heroic - and Dart aims to make the development process easier.
Dart is a &#8220;batteries included&#8221; project (the language comes with libraries, a package manager, an editor, and a VM) and
Dart code executes fast, making it an attractive option for modern web development.</p>

<p>Here are a few salient points about Dart:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dart is open source</li>
<li>it has a syntax that is likely to be familiar to most programmers</li>
<li>it is relatively easy to learn</li>
<li>it compiles to javascript that can be run in any modern browser</li>
<li>it can also be executed directly using a Chromium-based browser (nicknamed <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/">Dartium</a>) that includes the Dart virtual machine (VM)</li>
<li>it can coexist with javascript through the use of the <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/js-dart-interop/">interop library</a></li>
<li>it runs in the client and the server</li>
<li>it comes with a lightweight <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/editor/">editor</a> that you can use to write and debug applications</li>
<li>Dart programs run <em>fast</em> (many of the people who created Chrome&#8217;s V8 are leading the Dart project)</li>
<li>it offers concurrency through the use of <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html#ch03-dartisolate---concurrency-with-isolates">isolates</a></li>
<li>Dart has <strong>optional</strong> static type anotations that can help you organize your code, provide better debug messages in the editor and act as documentation</li>
<li>it comes with batteries included: an <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html#ch03-dart-html-using-html5-apis">HTML library</a>
for DOM manipulation, an <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html#ch03-dartio---file-and-socket-io-for-command-line-apps">IO library</a>
and a <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/docs/bleeding_edge/unittest.html">unittest library</a></li>
<li>it encourages modular code organization through the use of libraries</li>
<li>it has a package manager (<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub</a>) so you can integrate code from across the Dart ecosystem</li>
</ul>


<p>Is Dart going to change how we write web applications? While its still early - the language just had its M1 (Milestone 1)
release and is still not at the 1.0 stage - what I see so far is super encouraging.</p>
