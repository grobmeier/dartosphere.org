Dart libraries for both <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/libraries">Google APIs</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/wiki/ThirdPartyAddOns">Protobufs</a> are available for download. You can use Dart to access APIs from services such as Google+, YouTube, Drive, and more. You can also use Dart to interact with Protocol Buffers, Google's structured data encoding format. The libraries are open source and available today.<br /><br />The Dart client libraries for Google APIs cover a <a href="https://github.com/dart-google-apis">wide range of Google APIs</a>. Each client library is bundled as a pub package and uploaded to <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>, Dart's package hosting service. For example, check out the <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/google_youtube_v3_api">Dart library for the YouTube API on pub</a>. These libraries are maintained by a dedicated group of Dart community developers.<br /><br />Bonus: learn how to <a href="http://blog.dartwatch.com/2013/06/restful-crud-apis-with-appengine-cloud.html">generate Dart client libraries for your own Cloud Endpoint service</a>&nbsp;in this post from the Dartwatch blog.<br /><br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol Buffers</a>, or protobufs, are a way to encode and decode structured data for interop between various systems. Both the protobuf <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-protobuf">runtime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-protoc-plugin">code generator</a> are available for Dart, and are open source.
