<p>Yet another video from Google I/O 2013.</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Come see what&rsquo;s new in Dart with its comprehensive, open-source ecosystem for the modern web developer. Learn how to be more productive with a new language: future-based DOM, package manager, JS-interop, a tree-shaking compiler to JavaScript, SIMD, Web Components, a rich editor, and much more. You&rsquo;ll leave this talk all caught up with Dart and ready to make the web awesome.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>
