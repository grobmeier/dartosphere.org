<p>After a little summer break, TWID is back! I have missed researching and writing this part of the blog very much. Thanks for your patience.</p> <p>The Dart Editor and SDK was updated to version 0.7.2.1_r27268 with Search, Performance and Analysis fixes.</p> <p>The DartLang website has an updated <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/polymer-dart/">Polymer.dart</a> section. This is packed with examples and advice for upgrading from WebUI. A recent build of the Dart Editor also allows creation of a Polymer.dart app from the 'New Application...' menu.</p> <p>Over on Tumblr is <a href="http://pixelcyclr.tumblr.com/">PixelCycle movies</a> - my favourite is the missle command one. These were created with <a href="http://pixelcycle.appspot.com/m5878607637381120">Pixel Cycle</a> which was written in Dart with some Go server side. </p> <p>I had a quick go too!</p> <p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b_UF_podgSI/UjNOvftE6dI/AAAAAAAAsaw/8ySGuouBQbE/s1600/DivingIntoDart.gif" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b_UF_podgSI/UjNOvftE6dI/AAAAAAAAsaw/8ySGuouBQbE/s320/DivingIntoDart.gif" /></a></p> <p>Finally Kevin Moore shared some impressive <a href="https://plus.google.com/110066012384188006594/posts/Toq8T34HKmt">Dart performance</a> (dart2js) graphs on G+ and numbers which show some impressive advances.</p>
