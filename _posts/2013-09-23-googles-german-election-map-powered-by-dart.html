The Google Politics &amp; Elections team launched a German federal elections&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/elections/ed/de/districts">results map</a>&nbsp;powered by <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>, a new web programming language.<br /><br />Jason Brooks, a Google engineer that helped build the app, shares his experience using Dart: "We wanted to build a platform that would enable us to iterate quickly; to be flexible enough to allow us to experiment, while being robust enough to ensure the correctness of politically sensitive information. Dart has made it easy to build out a very capable platform. We are really excited about what we'll be able to do next."<br /><br />The application uses Google Maps to display results by district. Dart is used for the UI, and to draw the district boundaries.<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="600" src="https://www.google.com/elections/ed/de/districts/embed?hl=de" width="640"></iframe> <br /><br />The Politics &amp; Elections team wants "tools to help provide information about the federal election, but also offer a way to connect and engage with district-level candidates." It's great to see Dart being used to help the&nbsp;electoral process.<br /><br />Read more about the <a href="http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/2013/09/helping-german-voters-prepare-for.html">announcement</a>&nbsp;from the Politics &amp; Elections blog.
