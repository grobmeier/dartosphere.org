<p>Take this minimal <code>Point</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>class Point {
  num x;
  num y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);

  num distanceTo(Point other) {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you write tests for <code>Point</code>, you will probably want to set up one or more <code>point</code> objects that you can access in each
test. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>void main() {
  group("Point", (){
    setUp((){
      Point p1 = new Point(3, 4);
      Point p2 = new Point(3, 5);
    });
    test("distanceTo()", (){
      expect(p1.distanceTo(p2), equals(...));
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do this and the Editor starts complaining that it cannot make sense of <code>p1</code> or <code>p2</code>. Why?  Remember, <code>setUp()</code> simply calls the function passed
to it before each <code>test()</code> and our code defining <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> will therefore run every time. But (and this seems like a Captain Obvious mement) because <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>
are local to function called by <code>setUp()</code>, they cannot be accessed from outside that function.  But it takes only very small changes to take care of the access problem:</p>

<pre><code>void main() {
  group("Point", (){
    Point p1;
    Point p2;
    setUp((){
      p1 = new Point(3, 4);
      p2 = new Point(3, 5);
    });
    test("distanceTo()", (){
      expect(p1.distanceTo(p2), equals(34));
    });
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the function called by <code>setUp()</code> assigns a value to the already existing <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>.</p>
