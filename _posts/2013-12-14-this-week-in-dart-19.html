<p>Back after a small hiatus caused by the American Thanksgiving Holiday and the British theatre tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime">pantomime</a>! Here's a catch up TWID...</p> <p>The Dart DEV channel was updated Dart Editor version 1.0.3_r30939 (DEV) and the Dart SDK version 1.0.3.0_r3093. I am enjoying the new clearer tooltips.</p> <p>The <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code site</a> provides source code for classic computer demos and problems in a variety of languages. On one page I noticed 173 programming languages! I was happy to see that many of them had Dart versions. Well worth checking out.</p> <p>Dart Dares kicked off on G+ is a bit of fun coding challenge that started with a Secret Santa problem. See the post <a href="https://plus.google.com/118397406534237711570/posts/hvRFpThuY96">here</a>. I hope this continues into the new year!</p> <a href="http://gifti.me/i/3dW8Yu.gif" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://gifti.me/i/3dW8Yu.gif" /></a> <p>Minecraft creator Notch has continued to <a href="https://twitter.com/notch">Tweet</a> his Dart and WebGL experiments. He also announced he will be taking part in <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/12/12/im-in-and-ill-be-bringing-webgl/">LD28 48 hour game challenge</a> using these technologies. As usual he will be <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/notch">streaming</a> the weekend.</p> <p>I'm off to watch Notch - watch out for another HTML5 GFX demo later on the blog.</p>
