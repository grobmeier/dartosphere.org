Learn that thing you've been putting off.</i><br /><br />A year and change ago I did a <a href="http://work.j832.com/2010/09/getting-git-lunch-workshop-on-cap-hill.html">Getting Git</a> workshop at my coworker spot in Seattle, <a href="http://officenomads.com/">Office Nomads</a>.<br /><br />Getting bootstrapped--self-sufficient--on new technologies is tough, especially if you don't have a good relationship with someone&nbsp;experienced. Conferences and user groups can be intimidating and rarely offer opportunities to dig in from the beginning--especially for more than the length of a 50-minute presentation.<br /><br />I've learned a lot of fun technology since I left Microsoft 5 years ago--has it been that long?--in no small part because people in the know were kind enough to show me the way.<br /><br />There are three pieces of tech I love showing people and I feel--at least compared to beginners--I can offer a great starting point:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li><li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google Closure Compiler and Libraries</a>&nbsp;- used to build <a href="http://agent8ball.com/">Agent 008 Ball</a>, among other things at Pixel Lab.</li></ul>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/j832.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEdTTFJzM0RMR3hvUWh3Sk1HSWZJc0E6MQ">this form</a>. Once I find a sweet spot of interest, I'm going to schedule a workshop. A weeknight or a weekend morning/afternoon in Capitol Hill (Seattle).<br /><br />The price of admission? A donation to <a href="http://unitedrepublic.org/">United Republic</a> -- a group dedicated to getting money out of politics.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">You get to learn some great tech and we both get a warm fuzzy helping out a great organization.</div>
