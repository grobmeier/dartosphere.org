<p>The <a href="http://daftspaniel.com/dart/demo/binaryclock/out/binaryclock.html">Binary Clock HTML5 Canvas demo</a> has proved to be one of the most popular demos on this blog. I thought it would be interesting to visit it again in a Polymer project. It is a fairly simple rewrite as custom Polymer.dart element. I didn't see the need for databinding it. Some initialisation is carried out as required - I am still clearing up in my mind the lifecyle of a custom element. All a learning process!</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SGOYhyhcONI/UfUp4YyR4JI/AAAAAAAAKdA/g7kSyFLzO5o/s1600/binclock.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SGOYhyhcONI/UfUp4YyR4JI/AAAAAAAAKdA/g7kSyFLzO5o/s320/binclock.png" /></a></div> <p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/diveintodart-polymer-dart-examples/tree/master/polymerexamples/web/binaryclock">Github</a>. It is part of a larger Polymer project, rather having a repo per demo. It was a little tricky to deploy to HTML/JS and there's important optimisation bugs which the Dart team are still working on. Once these are cleared up, there'll be a nice demo site with all the examples from the blog on it. Not too far in the future!!</p>
