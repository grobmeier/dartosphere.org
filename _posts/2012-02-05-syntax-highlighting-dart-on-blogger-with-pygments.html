<a href="http://blog.lassus.se/" target="_blank">Olov Lassus</a> has recently added Dart support to <a href="http://pygments.org/" target="_blank">Pygments</a>, so I decided to try it out to add some syntax highlighting to my previous post.<br /><br />As far as I know, Pygments is the only syntax highlighter out there with Dart support that can easily output HTML. There are some Dart modes for popular text editors, and I believe a mode for CodeMirror, but Olov's contribution and Pygments is the only one I found that could output HTML that I could easily embed in Blogger.<br /><br />I had to install the development version of Pygments to get Dart support, so I installed <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, then <a href="http://selenic.com/mercurial" target="_blank">Mercurial</a>, then checked out the latest Pygments.<br /><br />Pygments comes with simple command line utility - pygmentize - that will generate HTML and CSS. To use it, just put your Dart snippets into files and run:<br /><blockquote><pre>./pygmentize -f html test.dart</pre></blockquote>That will output the HTML formatted version to your console that you can copy into Blogger's HTML editor.<br /><br />The next step is to generate some CSS to add to your template. Run pygmentize again with these flags:<br /><blockquote><pre>./pygmentize -f html -S colorful -a .highlight</pre></blockquote>and you'll get CSS that you can <a href="http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=175740" target="_blank">add to your site template</a>.<br /><br />I customized my CSS a little bit, but I couldn't quite get the styling I wanted, particularly with interpolated strings. Pygments or the Dart highlighter (I don't know which is responsible) doesn't look like it'll nest &lt;span&gt; tags, so I can't target a name within a string. It also treats all names the same, whether they are function declarations or calls. I personally like to highlight just declarations.<br /><br />It's a good start though. Much thanks to Olov!
