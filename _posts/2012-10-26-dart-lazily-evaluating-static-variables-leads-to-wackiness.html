<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>It is now possible in Dart to initialize top-level (i.e. static) variables using any expression. The expression gets evaluated lazily. When I first heard about this, my instant reaction was fear because laziness and imperative programming don't really get along. At the time, I hadn't seen the <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2012/02/static-variables-no-longer-have-to-be.html">blog post</a> where Gilad admitted that plainly.</p> <p>Hence, I spent a couple hours that night trying to come up with ways this could lead to wackiness. I asked Gilad about it, and he said, "Laziness and statefulness can cause scary problems, I know. You can get into these Hesienbugs, where things only show up when you look, so as you debug the problem disappears."</p> <p>Just to prove the point, I came up with the following Dart program:</p> <pre>import "dart:io";<br />import "dart:math";<br /><br />var varA = changeVarB();<br />var varB = 1;<br /><br />int changeVarB() {<br />  varB += 1;<br />  return 0;<br />}<br /><br />main() {<br />  print("$varB");<br />  var seed = new Date.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;<br />  var nextBool = new Random(seed).nextBool();<br />  if (nextBool) {<br />    varA;  // This looks like a no-op, right?<br />  }<br />  print("$varB");<br />  varA;<br />  print("$varB");  <br />}</pre> <p>Can you guess what this prints? Half the time, it prints 1, 1, 2. The other half the time, it prints 1, 2, 2. The first time I print varB, it's value is 1. However, the first time varA is evaluated, changeVarB() gets called (i.e. evaluated lazily). From then on, varB's value will be 2.</p> <p>Of course, being able to initialize top-level variables to things that aren't constant is really useful, so I'm not sure I'd advocate changing this. Nonetheless, it's something I think you should be careful with.</p></div>
