That's 40% smaller that a year ago.<br /><br />The gzip size – which is what really matters, since it's the cost-on-the-wire – is at 70.5KB. Over 20% smaller.<br /><br />This includes content like the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/pop-pop-win/blob/master/web/texture_data.dart" target="_blank">texture mapping data</a> which is 39KB on disk.<br /><br />For an app with high quality images, audio, and fonts the total cost of the compiled code come in right at 4% of the total download for the app.<br /><br />Impressive!</div>
