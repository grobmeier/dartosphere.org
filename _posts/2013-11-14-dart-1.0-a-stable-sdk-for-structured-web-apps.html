In the two years since we first <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/10/dart-language-for-structured.html">announced Dart</a>, we’ve been working closely with early adopters to mature the project and grow the community. This release marks Dart's transition to a production-ready option for web developers.  <br /><br />The Dart SDK 1.0 includes everything you need to write structured web applications: a simple yet powerful programming language, robust tools, and comprehensive core libraries. Together, these pieces can help make your development workflow simpler, faster, and more scalable as your projects grow from a few scripts to full-fledged web applications.  <br /><br />On the tools side, the SDK includes <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/">Dart Editor</a>, a lightweight but powerful Dart development environment. We wanted to give developers the tools to manage a growing code base, so we added code completion, refactoring, jump to definition, a debugger, hints and warnings, and lots more. Dart also offers an instant edit/refresh cycle with <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/">Dartium</a>, a custom version of Chromium with the native Dart VM. Outside the browser, the Dart VM can also be used for asynchronous server side computation.  <br /><br />For deployment, dart2js is a translator that allows your Dart code to run in <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/support/faq.html#what-browsers-supported">modern browsers</a>. The performance of generated JavaScript has improved dramatically since our initial release and is in many cases getting close to that of idiomatic JavaScript. In fact, the dart2js output of the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/performance/">DeltaBlue benchmark</a> now runs even faster than idiomatic JavaScript. Similarly, dart2js output code size has been reduced substantially. The generated JavaScript for the game <a href="http://dart-lang.github.io/pop-pop-win/">Pop, Pop, Win!</a> is now <a href="http://work.j832.com/2013/10/dart-to-javascript-output-size-what.html">40% smaller</a> than it was a year ago. Performance of the VM continues to improve as well; it’s now between 42% to 130% faster than idiomatic JavaScript running in V8, depending on the benchmark.    <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1e98Rh9k15M/UoPsgJqxR6I/AAAAAAAAAIA/a5hEgJd6Oyo/s1600/deltabluebenchmark.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="220" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1e98Rh9k15M/UoPsgJqxR6I/AAAAAAAAAIA/a5hEgJd6Oyo/s400/deltabluebenchmark.png" width="484" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">DeltaBlue benchmark results</td></tr></tbody></table></div>The Dart SDK also features the <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">Pub</a> package manager, with more than 500 packages from the community. Fan favorites include <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart">AngularDart</a> and <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/polymer-dart/">polymer.dart</a>, which provide higher-level frameworks for building web apps. Dart developers can continue using their favorite JavaScript libraries with <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/articles/js-dart-interop/">Dart-JavaScript interop</a>.  <br /><br />Going forward, the Dart team will focus on improving Dartium, increasing Dart performance, and ensuring the platform remains rock solid. In particular, changes to core technologies will be backward-compatible for the foreseeable future.   <br /><br />Today’s release marks the first time Dart is officially production-ready, and we’re seeing teams like <a href="https://www.blossom.io/">Blossom</a>, <a href="http://www.montagebook.com/">Montage</a>, <a href="https://www.soundtrap.com/">Soundtrap</a>, <a href="http://mandrill.com/">Mandrill</a>, Google's internal <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/11/angular-announces-angulardart.html">CRM</a> app and <a href="http://www.google.com/elections/ed/de/districts">Google Elections</a>, already successfully using Dart in production. In addition, companies like <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/05/adobes-flash-pro-cc-exports-to-dart-and.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://drone.io/">drone.io</a>, and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">JetBrains</a> have started to add Dart support to their products.  <br /><br />To get started, head over to <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">dartlang.org</a> and join the conversation at our <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114566943291919232850">Dartisans community on Google+</a>. We’re excited to see what you will build with the new stable <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart SDK 1.0</a>.   <br /><br />Posted by Lars Bak, Software Engineer and Chief Dartisan
