With the new milestone release today, Dart has become more stable: we have fixed over <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=closed-after%3A2013/6/18%20status%3AFixed&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Area%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary%20Closed&amp;sort=-closed%20id&amp;num=1000&amp;start=0">650 bugs</a> since our <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/06/release-notes-for-darts-beta-release.html">last milestone release</a> in June. Moreover, a reduced API churn in the core libraries and continuous improvement of the developer experience (e.g. in debugging) has improved the overall stability of the platform substantially.<br /><br />Reflection has been improved in the Dart VM. For example, reflectively performing a new invocation on an object is now 20 times faster. The VM, in addition to ia32 and x64, has also been ported to ARM and MIPS.<br /><br />Debugging performance was improved for stepping in both Dartium and standalone Dart VM. In particular, we have addressed debugger usability issues, such as:<br /><ul><li>Stepping into closures, callbacks and emulated functions.</li><li>Stepping across asynchronous invocations.</li><li>Support for top level exception handling.</li></ul>In the Editor, the new analysis engine is now fully spec compliant. The Editor also provides hints on unused library imports and dead code, helping developers keep their code slim over time. Additionally, Mac users will find that Editor binaries are now signed so you no longer have to lower the security settings when launching the Editor.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yhvrrgGC7Dg/Uhy399tVjOI/AAAAAAAAAgc/ea7S2iecG0k/s1600/hint.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yhvrrgGC7Dg/Uhy399tVjOI/AAAAAAAAAgc/ea7S2iecG0k/s640/hint.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />You can download Dart Editor and Dart SDK from <a href="http://dartlang.org/">dartlang.org</a>, and we invite you to join the <a href="http://g.co/dartisans">Dartisans community</a> on Google+ and file <a href="http://dartbug.com/new">feature requests and bugs</a>.
