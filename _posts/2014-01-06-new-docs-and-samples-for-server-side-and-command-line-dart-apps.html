The Dart team published new docs and samples showing how to write command-line and server-side apps with Dart. The Dart VM's <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/dart_io.html">dart:io library</a> provides access to files, directories, sockets, web sockets, SSL, TCP, UDP, HTTP, and more. Community packages on pub.dartlang.org provide higher-level frameworks and libraries.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jrPg172COQs/Uss1Xs220iI/AAAAAAAAC1A/R4si6HVTTIw/s1600/dart+on+the+server.png" height="231" width="400" /></div><br /><br />The <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/serverguide.html">Command-Line Apps for Dart Programmer's Guide</a> starts to collect resources for the new server-side and command-line Dart app developers.
