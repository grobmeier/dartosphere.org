<h2>Creating a dummy project</h2>

<p>I created a very simple project, <code>droneDemo</code>, to show how to set up Continuous Integration
on drone.io for Dart projects. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/shailen/droneDemo">here on Github</a>.</p>

<p><code>droneDemo</code> defines just two methods, <code>add()</code> and <code>multiply()</code>. These
can be found in <code>lib/</code>. Tests for these methods can be found in <code>test/</code>. The
<code>pubspec.yaml</code> file needs to declare a <code>unittest</code> dependency for these tests to
work.</p>

<p>This is about as simple a project as you can have and there is little need for
explanation. But it is worth delving into 2 points:</p>

<p>1) You should add <code>packages</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code>. This is to tell <code>git</code> not to
commit the <code>symlinks</code> created by <code>pub</code> to version control. These symlinks are
meaningful in the context of your filesystem but will trip drone.io.</p>

<p>If you already started your demo project and ended up with the symlinks, remove
them.</p>

<p>2) drone.io needs a way to run all your tests. So far, Dart does not ship with a
test runner, so you&#8217;ll have to cobble together something yourself.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I did: my tests live in 2 different files, <code>test/add_test.dart</code> and
<code>test/multiply_test.dart</code>. I declared both files as libraries (see the <code>library add_test;</code>
and the <code>library multiply_test;</code> declaration at the top of each file) and
<code>import</code>ed  components from them into <code>test/test_runner.dart</code>.</p>

<p>   import &#8220;package:unittest/unittest.dart&#8221;;
   import &#8220;add_test.dart&#8221; as add_test;
   import &#8220;multiply_test.dart&#8221; as multiply_test;</p>

<p>   void main() {</p>

<pre><code> add_test.main();
 multiply_test.main();
</code></pre>

<p>   }</p>

<p>So, calling <code>dart test/add_test.dart</code> or <code>dart test/multiply_test.dart</code> runs
only one test; calling <code>dart/test_runner.dart</code> runs both the tests.</p>

<p>With this out of the way, we can shift our attention to drone.io.</p>

<h2>Drone.io: Basic Setup</h2>

<p>Set up account at <code>https://drone.io/signup</code>.</p>

<p>On your <code>dashboard</code>, click on the <code>New Project</code> on the top right.</p>

<p>Pick <code>Dart</code> as the project language.</p>

<p>Pick <code>Git</code> as your Repository type.</p>

<p>Add the project name (I added <code>droneDemo</code>).</p>

<p>Add the Repository URL (mine was <code>https://github.com/shailen/droneDemo.git</code>).
Make sure your github repo is set to use the <code>http</code> method, not the <code>ssh</code> method.</p>

<p>Press <code>Create</code>.</p>

<h2>Configuring your Build</h2>

<p>After you press <code>Create</code>, you will be redirected to the <code>script/config</code> page.
Here, you will have to tell drone.io how to run your tests.</p>

<p>In the <code>Commands</code> section, type the following:</p>

<pre><code>pub install
dart test/test_runner.dart
</code></pre>

<p>Remember <code>test/test_runner.dart</code> was our consolidating test runner? This is
where the trouble we went through sewing our tests together pays off.</p>

<p>Press <code>Save</code> and when you get the message that tells you the build was
successfully saved, press the blue <code>Build Now</code> button at the top.</p>

<p>A popup will appear with a <code>Build Output</code> link.  Click that link.</p>

<p>Voila! You are swimming in a sea of green!</p>

<p>My build output can be seen at: <code>https://drone.io/shailen/droneDemo/1</code></p>

<h2>Setting up Continuous Build</h2>

<p>Click on <code>settings</code> for your <code>drone.io</code> project</p>

<p>Click on <code>General</code> in the left column. You will see a couple of links under <code>Build Hooks</code>. Copy the top one.</p>

<p>Now, go back to your project on <code>github</code>. Mine is at <code>https://github.com/shailen/droneDemo</code>.</p>

<p>Click on <code>Settings</code>.</p>

<p>Click on <code>Service Hooks</code> (left column).</p>

<p>Click on the <code>WebHook Urls</code> link at the top.</p>

<p>Paste the <code>build hook</code> you had copied earlier in the text input box provided
and press <code>Update Settings</code>.</p>

<p>From now on, every time you commit to your project on github, drone.io will run
all your tests.</p>

<p>I changed one of my tests so that it was failing and pushed to github. No
surprise, the build now show <code>Failed</code> (<code>https://drone.io/shailen/droneDemo</code>).</p>
