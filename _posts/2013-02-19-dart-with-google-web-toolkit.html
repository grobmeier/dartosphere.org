I know that there are a lot of GWT developers out there who would like to give Dart a shot, but they aren't sure how because they already have a large, successful app that's written in GWT. I'm going to show you ways to integrate Dart into your existing GWT application without having to rewrite it from scratch.<br /><br />To do this, I've built a sample application that uses both GWT and Dart. I'll show you how to setup a development environment so that you can work with both technologies. Then, I'll show you a variety of ways in which you can get GWT and Dart to interoperate, such as:<br /><ul><li>Using GWT and Dart to manage different parts of the same page</li><li>Using Dart to retrieve JSON from a Java servlet</li><li>Using window.postMessage and JSNI to pass messages between GWT and Dart</li><li>Using JavaScript, JSNI, and Dart's js package for synchronous interoperability between GWT and Dart</li><li>Using CustomEvent objects and Elemental to pass messages between GWT and Dart</li></ul>Rather than show you a one-size-fits-all solution, I decided to show you a bunch of approaches so that you could pick the right tool for the job. Each of them has stengths and weaknesses, and I'll cover those along the way as well.<br /><br />Aside from watching the video, you can also download the <a href="http://bit.ly/dart_with_gwt">source code</a> or view the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-with-x-samples/blob/master/gwt/GwtApplication/transcript.md">video transcript</a>.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/F33aPc5FjVo" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />As always, we invite you to join the discussion on the <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/mailing-list">Dart mailing list</a>, and ask us questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart">Stack Overflow</a>. Your feedback is important. Thanks for checking out Dart! </div>
