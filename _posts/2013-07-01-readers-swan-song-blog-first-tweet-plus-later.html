Drop a link on Google+, Twitter, whatever. Don't grow your content in a walled garden.</i><br /><br />I spend my days swimming in a pool of Google's Kool-Aid: Chrome, Dart, Closure Compiler, Plus, Analytics, oh yeah, and Search.<br /><br />Util today, Google Reader (R.I.P.) was towards the top of that list. I'm now one of many jumping between a handful of want-to-be alternatives with no clear winner. While I'm still not settled on how I'm going to consume blogs, I have come to a conclusion on the production side.<br /><br />I'm going to blog more -- a lot more.<br /><br />I have a mountain of love for Google, but in end it's a company with share holders. While my site is set up via Google Apps and Blogger serves my RSS/ATOM feed, I own the domain and the content. I can move it all to Heroku or Azure tomorrow if I wanted.<br /><br />That's a good thing.<br /><br />You don't need to create a Google+ account or ignore sponsored tweets for Hydraulic Fracturing to see my rants.<br /><br />That's also good thing.<br /><br />So let's take the death of Reader as a call to action.<br /><br />Let's restart discussions...<br /><ul><li>About ATOM and RSS.</li><li>About metadata and aggregation.</li><li>About annotation and reputation.</li><li>About <a href="http://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> and <a href="https://app.net/">app.net</a> and other folks trying to evolve a stagnant space.</li></ul>See you on the open, aggregated, hyperlinked, distributed, web.</div>
