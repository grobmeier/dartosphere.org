<p>For this demo we travel back to the 19th Century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve">Peano Curve</a> - a space filling curve discovered 1890 by Italian mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">Guiseppe Peano</a>. He went on to some interesing work in Fractals.</p> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QoDGDWTDBLY/UqyDK4KVldI/AAAAAAAAv-w/YQzWkRr5cvY/s1600/PeanoCurve.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QoDGDWTDBLY/UqyDK4KVldI/AAAAAAAAv-w/YQzWkRr5cvY/s1600/PeanoCurve.png" /></a> <p>Whilst researching the Peano curve, I found the best way to implement it was recursively and a Python sample showed a neat example using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle Graphics</a>. Turtle Graphics was always in those computer books I grew up with (1980s!) complete with robot turtle usually with a pen attached. I had never actually code anything using it- turns out a basic turtle class is pretty easy so I chose this to implement this demo. It is a very fun abstraction / model. I threw in some colour to liven things up and rendered to the HTML5 Canvas. Hopefully I will revisit the turtles soon and have an animate implementation of the Curve. For now, here is the <a href="http://daftspaniel.com/dart/demo/peanocurve/turtlepool.html">live demo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/dart-peanocurve/tree/master/web">GitHub</a>.</p> <p>Can someone work on the robot for me? I'll bring the pens :-)</p>
