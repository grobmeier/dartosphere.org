<p>Are you ready for a Polymer.dart heavy edition of TWID? Let's go...</p> <p>The Dart Editor was updated to  0.8.1_r28355 and the Dart SDK to 0.8.1.2_r28355. This updated includes performance, stability and features updates. The find feature (always an important part of a text editor!) has key binding fixes. Dartium now provides a Dart REPL at all times - not just when a breakpoint is reached. Polymer.dart brought fully up to date with Polymer.js which brought some important changes and updates.</p> <p>The DartLang site has an extensive tutorial - <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/polymer-intro/">Define a Custom Element</a> - <i>Create a custom HTML element using Polymer</i>. If you are looking to move onto Polymer from Web UI then stop on by Matt Butler's blog for 12 tips for porting <a href="http://blog.butlermatt.me/?p=13">'Polymer Plunge'</a>. If that isn't enough for you, check out Seth Ladd's <a href="https://github.com/sethladd/dart-polymer-dart-examples">47 mini samples</a> for Polymer over on GitHub.</p> <p>vdrones 0.12.0 shows some impressive 3D visuals. Watch this short video then pop along to the <a href="http://vdrones.appspot.com/#/a/alpha0">website</a> to fly around for yourself!</p>   <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MsREieeQrFY/UlmDvNikmII/AAAAAAAAt4o/YB86PwITetY/s1600/drone.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MsREieeQrFY/UlmDvNikmII/AAAAAAAAt4o/YB86PwITetY/s320/drone.png" /></a></p> <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lHG-vU_VfH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>Diving down from the UI level, the core of Dart has been making advances as shown in this <a href="https://plus.google.com/118397406534237711570/posts/1jtDyXXyBgG">benchmark</a> for Sudoku solving that was shared on G+. Prolific Dart blogger Chris Strom hit a milestone of <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/trying-to-figure-out-what-i-can-test.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+dartosphere+(The+Dartosphere)">900 daily blogs</a> in a row - an impressive benchmark for us other bloggers to follow!</p> <p>Finally Happy Birthday Dart! Yes Dart turned 2 years old on 11 October - many happy returns.</p>
