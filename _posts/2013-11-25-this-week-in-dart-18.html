<p>This week the Dart Editor was updated to version 1.0.0_r30338 (DEV) and the Dart SDK to version 1.0.0.7_r303384.</p> <p>Dart Channels were revealed this week - see the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/misc/UXRMVmX_6EQ">announcement here</a>. With 1.0 being released, those wishing for a stable build will not want a weekly update. This blog will largely track the DEV channel (so no change really).</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/spark">Spark</a> describes itself as <i>'A Chrome app based development environment with a reusable library of GUI widgets'</i>. This application was given some publicity this week with some coverage over at <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57613342-93/google-building-spark-a-web-based-development-tool/">CNET</a> and others.</p> <p>The Chrome Dev Summit had a presentation on Dart: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1aPR43fhIWk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> If you have used Dart for a while, the first part of the presentation will be familiar but there's some great detail in there later on about how dart2js works so it is well worth watching. </p> <p>The WebUI mailing list has closed now that library is old news. Long live the dart-web which will cover everything web related for Dart. See the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/web-ui/cb_gCX53GL8/TEPPlbiCW84J">announcement</a>.</p> <p>Eclipse Con 2014 will feature a presentation <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2014/session/developing-dart-editor">'Developing the Dart Editor'</a> by Eric Clayberg and Dan Rubel. Hopefully there will be a video of that one.</p> <p>That's it for now. Have a great Darty week!</p>
