<p>No update to the Dart Editor or Dart SDK this week. There was a lot of activity on the mailing list trailing upcoming updates to Polymer.dart and Dartium. The main points for Polymer.dart: size of the output JS will be dramatically reduced, initialisation has changed and main() will be going away. The next release will be very significant!</p> <p>Video Discussion - iForms Autopsy and discuss of Dart, Dart Web Toolkit and Polymer:<br/> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/i99xOtrOmEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>If you are in the SF area, there is a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DartSF/events/145283932/">StageXL Hands-On Codelab</a><br/> <i>"Whether you're looking to build the next Angry Birds or just find interesting ways to display your company's financial data, StageXL & Dart offer everything you need for 2D graphics or games. The StageXL library gives you access to all the best techniques & tools traditionally used by Flashâ„¢ & Starling developers</i>"</p> <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RVjYewIX__U/Ul59O8PoqTI/AAAAAAAAt_s/2A0D-G20Ddc/s1600/eyeburstdude.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RVjYewIX__U/Ul59O8PoqTI/AAAAAAAAt_s/2A0D-G20Ddc/s320/eyeburstdude.png" /></a></p> <p>WebGL continues to be popular with Dart. Check out this Dart/WebGL port of the Processing sketch "Untangle" over on <a href="http://www.fugitive.io/blog/2013/10/17/untangle-part-3/">Paul Sanderson's blog</a>.</p> <p>After all that, if you need to unwind why not play a game of <a href="http://leafinity.github.io/eyeBurst/">EyeBurst</a> - a Halloween inspired web game. Dart <a href="https://github.com/urchinfinity/cubeCrush">source code</a> is available too. Some nice bat animations there!</p>
