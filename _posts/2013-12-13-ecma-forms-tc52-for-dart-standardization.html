This week <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">Ecma</a> created a new technical committee named <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC52.htm">TC52</a> to publish a standard specification of the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> language. We’re excited about this milestone in the evolution of Dart and the web.<br /><br />Dart is ready for standardization. As of last month’s <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/11/dart-10-stable-sdk-for-structured-web.html">1.0 SDK release</a>, Dart is now officially stable and mature enough for production use. We’ll be collaborating with the broader web community via TC52 to responsibly evolve the language going forward.  <br /><br />The new standardization process is an important step towards a future where Dart runs natively in web browsers. Dart apps can be fast when compiled to JavaScript, but an embedded Dart VM enables <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/performance/">even better performance</a>. <br /><br />We're thrilled to have a dedicated technical committee working on Dart. We also feel confident that Ecma—the home of standards such as JavaScript, Eiffel, and C#—is the right place to help guide the evolution of the Dart language. If you’d like to get involved, please <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/join.htm">join the committee</a>.
