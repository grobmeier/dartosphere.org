Ecma will hold a workshop on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>&nbsp;on September 20, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts, US. We encourage both members and nonmembers to let us know they are&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/5mG2tW">interested in attending</a>.<br /><br />In April 2013, Dart was proposed for standardization by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/(http://ecma-international.org/">Ecma International</a>. In June 2013 at the Ecma General Assembly a successful presentation on Dart was held, a draft scope of work was proposed, and the topic of standardization was discussed.<br /><br />The Ecma GA has decided to progress with the project, and will hold the workshop on Dart before the October Ecma CC meeting. In the workshop we'll give a short introduction to Dart, set the direction for the possible future Dart work in Ecma, and discuss potential new features in Dart.<br /><br />Members of the Dart project, including Dart's "Chief Specification Officer" Gilad Bracha, will be in attendance.<br /><br />The workshop is a good opportunity to help drive the evolution of the Dart language. Please&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/5mG2tW">register your interest</a>&nbsp;before September 6.
