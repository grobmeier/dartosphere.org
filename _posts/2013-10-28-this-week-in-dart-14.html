<p>Apologies for the slight delay in this edition of TWID - I was doing a sponsored cycle at the weekend! I was also putting Crouton back on my Chromebook. Some more installing still to do. If you have any feedback on TWID such as the schedule or content, please leave a constructive comment! Also let me know if you have created or found something that deserves to be covered.</p> <p>The Dart Editor was updated to version 0.8.5_r28990 and the Dart SDK to version 0.8.5.1_r28990. This release includes performance, stability and features updates. Polymer has had drastic changes - see the mailing list for advice on porting - sure a complete guide will pop up soon. The usual samples have been updated and other docs are on their way. One very positive change is the reduction of the JS produced when deploying a Polymer application. For more details see the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/misc/Pqjlff_HJAw">announcement</a>.</p> <p>Packages are at the core of Dart and to aid understanding, <b>pub</b> commands are being renamed: <br/><li>pub install is now pub get <li>pub update is now pub upgrade <li>pub deploy is now pub build </p><p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zUtYPHmykvw/Um52PG2PTMI/AAAAAAAAuJU/wwfC6hOGPHM/s1600/conwaygameoflife.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zUtYPHmykvw/Um52PG2PTMI/AAAAAAAAuJU/wwfC6hOGPHM/s320/conwaygameoflife.png" /></a></p><p>Naoto Hc's blog has a <a href="http://blog.naotohc.com/2013/10/symbol-literal-i-probably-be-abusing-it.html">post </a>regarding usage of symbols whilst implementing Conway's Game of Life in Dart. Source Code available. This is a good example of a non-Polymer/non-WebUI web application written in Dart.</p> <p>Just a short TWID this week - back with another demo before TWID15 if this install goes well!</p>
