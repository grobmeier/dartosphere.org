Learn how dart2js generates efficient JavaScript code with the video and slides from "<a href="http://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/sessions#dart">Dart for the Modern Web Developer</a>" talk from <a href="http://g.co/chromedevsummit">Chrome Dev Summit</a>. This presentation, from Dart engineers Kasper Lund and Seth Ladd, takes a look into dart2js, a Dart to JavaScript compiler, and showed how it generates efficient JavaScript code. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FqsU3TbUw_s" width="640"></iframe><br /><br /><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/performance">Performance charts</a> show dart2js generates JavaScript code that is sometimes faster than hand-written JavaScript code. The compiler is able to analyze the entire Dart program for both local and global optimizations. The presentation shows some of the techniques, with plenty of code examples.<br /><br />Check out all the great content from <a href="http://g.co/chromedevsummit">Chrome Dev Summit</a>, including content on mobile web development, performance, DevTools, and more.
