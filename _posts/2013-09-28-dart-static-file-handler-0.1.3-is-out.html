<p>A few days ago I released version 0.1.3 of the <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/static_file_handler">static_file_handler</a>, my first real contribution to the open source community since ca. December 2005. It&rsquo;s actually being used in a <a href="https://github.com/Daegalus/fukiya">framework</a>, and probably in a handful of projects &ndash; I&rsquo;m saying that based on the fact that I received a pull request and someone opened a couple of issues<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I must say that I&rsquo;m enjoying doing it: I like the feeling of being part of something, releasing code that other developers are using somewhere else in the world on cool projects. Currently I&rsquo;m working on version 0.2.0, whose to-do list already includes e.g. support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETags</a>, HTTP requests with multiple ranges, and few other improvements that you can see on the <a href="https://github.com/DanieleSalatti/static-file-handler/issues?milestone=1&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">list of issues on GitHub</a>. And that&rsquo;s the reason for this post: what features would you like to see in it?</p>
