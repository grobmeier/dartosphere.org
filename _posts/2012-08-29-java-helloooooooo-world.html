<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>I was talking to my buddy, Peter von der Ah√©, today about optimizing startup time. He asked me to guess how many classes the JVM had to load for a simple hello world application written in Java. He also asked me how long such a program would take to run. I didn't know the answers, so he quickly typed it out on my friend's MacBook Pro.</p> <p>Here's how to see how many classes are loaded:</p> <pre>java -verbose:class Hello</pre> <p>That results in 594 classes:</p> <pre><br />[Opened /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar]<br />[Loaded java.lang.Object from /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar]<br />[Loaded java.io.Serializable from /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar]<br />[Loaded java.lang.Comparable from /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar]<br />...<br />[Loaded java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableMap from /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar]<br /></pre> <p>It takes roughly 0.2 seconds to run hello world:</p> <pre>time java Hello<br />Hello, World!<br /><br />real 0m0.212s<br />user 0m0.221s<br />sys 0m0.051s</pre> <p>Kind of interesting. I know that this is the world's stupidest benchmark, but I decided to write the same thing in Python. It takes 0.04 seconds.</p> <p>Dart currently takes 0.02 seconds.</p> <p>Ruby 1.8.7 takes 0.009 seconds.</p> <p>C takes 0.006 seconds.</p> <p>(Warning: bad jokes coming...)</p> <p>Of course, the real reason C is so fast is because it doesn't have any class ;-)</p> <p>As I said earlier, this is a totally stupid benchmark. Never pick a programming language based on how long it takes to run hello world. What happens if you have to write a program that says something other than hello world, such as "hej, verden"? ;-)</p>  <br /></div>
