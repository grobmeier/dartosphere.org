<p>In case you may have missed <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=6614">the action</a>, reflective access to metadata is now a reality in both the Dart VM and in <em>dart2js</em>. While it is not yet completely finished (some less common use cases are not yet implemented) the majority of use cases that I care about are now working since the <em>0.5.20.2_r24160</em> Beta release.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/docs/bleeding_edge/dart_mirrors/DeclarationMirror.html#metadata">public API</a> for introspection of metadata could not be simpler; it consists of a single getter on <code>DeclarationMirror</code>:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='dart'><span class='n'>List</span><span class='o'>&lt;</span><span class='n'>InstanceMirror</span><span class='o'>&gt;</span> <span class='kd'>get</span> <span class='n'>metadata</span><span class='p'>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/docs/bleeding_edge/dart_mirrors/DeclarationMirror.html#metadata">dartdoc</a>, the return value of this getter is a list of (instance mirrors on) <em>constant objects</em>. In other words, the annotations that you may apply to declarations in your source code and later retrieve using <code>dart:mirrors</code> must be defined in your program as <em>constants</em>. Let’s consider the two types of annotations that are set forth in the language <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec/latest/dart-language-specification.html#h.d0rowtffuudf">specification</a>.</p>

<h2 id="compiletime_constant_variable">Compile-Time Constant Variable</h2>

<p>This is probably the most common form of annotation. As an example, let us define an annotation <code>@test</code> for marking methods as test functions:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='dart'><span class='kd'>const</span> <span class='n'>test</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kd'>const</span> <span class='n'>_Test</span><span class='p'>();</span>
<span class='kd'>class</span> <span class='nc'>_Test</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
  <span class='kd'>const</span> <span class='n'>_Test</span><span class='p'>();</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The constant variable <code>test</code> which we have defined above serves as the <em>identifier</em> portion of the annotation. Notice how we have assigned to the <code>test</code> variable the sole instance of the private class <code>_Test</code> that we have also defined. While this private class is not strictly required to define a constant variable, this pattern seems to be the current convention used.</p>

<p>With this metadata defined, we can now use it to annotate some test functions in our source code:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='dart'><span class='err'>@</span><span class='n'>test</span>
<span class='kt'>void</span> <span class='n'>testThatTheSkyIsBlue</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
  <span class='c1'>// look up</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, you might want to run off and hack out a patch to the <code>unittest</code> package which detects such an annotation. But I haven’t gotten to my main point yet, so stick around!</p>

<h2 id="call_to_a_constant_constructor">Call to a Constant Constructor</h2>

<p>The second form of annotation provided by the language specification is that of a call to a constant constructor. What this provides for is a way to pass arguments (other <em>constants</em>) to your annotation. As an example, let us define another annotation for marking test functions that we expect to throw an error:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='dart'><span class='kd'>class</span> <span class='nc'>ExpectError</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
  <span class='kd'>final</span> <span class='n'>Type</span> <span class='n'>errorType</span><span class='p'>;</span>
  <span class='kd'>const</span> <span class='n'>ExpectError</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>errorType</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The class <code>ExpectError</code> which we have defined above is actualy very similar to the private <code>_Test</code> class which we defined previously. The difference is that the <em>const</em> constructor of <code>ExpectError</code> takes an argument, the <code>Type</code> of error to expect.</p>

<p>With this metadata in hand, we can annotate test functions as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='dart'><span class='err'>@</span><span class='n'>test</span>
<span class='err'>@</span><span class='n'>ExpectError</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>StateError</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='kt'>void</span> <span class='n'>testThatTheSkyIsBlue</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
  <span class='c1'>// do something bad which throws a StateError</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="making_a_case_for_style">Making a Case for Style</h2>

<p>That brings me to the point in question, which is a matter of <em>style</em>. The astute reader has noticed that our two annotations differ in the case of their first letter: <em>t</em> for <code>@test</code> and <em>E</em> for <code>@ExpectError(StateError)</code>. I think we may all agree that there are but two solutions to this problem!</p>

<p>1) <em>lowerCamelCase</em> identifiers.</p>

<p>This is the most common (only?) type of identifier in the wild in <em>today’s</em> Dart, so it is tempting to say that all identifiers should begin with a lower-case letter. However, that would entail naming classes such as <code>ExpectError</code> in lower-camel-case (<code>class expectError</code> ?) which violates the current <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/#names">dart style guide</a>, and feels pretty wrong to me.</p>

<p>2) <em>UpperCamelCase</em> identifiers</p>

<p>This might require breaking users of existing metadata such as <code>@observable</code>, but I believe the libraries that are using metadata are all at an early enough stage where such breaking change is acceptable. The declaration of <code>const test</code> is actually in violation of the current <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/#names">dart style guide</a> which states that constants should be named using ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES. There seems to be more wiggle room here, and a chance to clarify the preferred style for <em>annotation identifier constants</em> to be <em>UpperCamelCase</em>.</p>

<p>My preference is for #2, <em>UpperCamelCase</em> identifiers for metadata. What I am most interested in is <em>consistency</em>. The ability to reflect on metadata is a game-changing feature, and I believe we will see an explosion of new annotations now that it is available; so I would love to see this addressed in the Dart style guide sooner rather than later.</p>
