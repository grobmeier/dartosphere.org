<p>Dart Editor version 0.8.7_r29341 and Dart SDK version 0.8.7.0_r29341 were released this week. Some tidy up the libraries for JSON, Platform and a refactoring of Isolate. Various fixes and improvements to the editor's code completion. See the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/list">change log</a> for all details.</p> <p>Minecraft creator <a href="https://twitter.com/notch">Notch</a> caught the attention of Dart developers when he tweeted 'I'm so nervous and hyped about Minecon, I'm considering learning Dart'.

The Dart team are in Antwerp to host a Q & A and Buzzword bingo session. More details <a href="https://plus.google.com/111395306401981598462/posts/4MYif8eDNxP">here</a>.</p> <p>Size matters (especially JS size) and Kevin Moore has some reflections on the progress of Dart in this <a href="http://work.j832.com/2013/10/dart-to-javascript-output-size-what.html">blog post</a>. Looking positive!</p> <p>This keyboard is being a little temperamental so I will sign off will I still can type. Have a great week!</p>
