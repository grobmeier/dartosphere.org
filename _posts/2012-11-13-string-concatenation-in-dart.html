<p>Let us start with a simple helloworld.dart example and use it to see how string concatenation works in Dart.</p>

<pre><code>void main() {
  print("hello, world!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above works, obviously. Now, if we were given this greeting as two strings, &#8220;hello, &#8221; and &#8220;world!&#8221;, and asked
to join them together, we might be tempted to do:</p>

<pre><code>"hello, " + "world!"
</code></pre>

<p>This works in lots of languages, but not in Dart. The + operator has not been overloaded in the String class, the above code throws
a <code>NoSuchMethodError</code>.</p>

<p>Not a problem: Dart gives us lots of ways to contcatenate strings. I list the most common ways
below. <em>Above the examples you will see some <strong>crude</strong> benchmarks that I calculated by running each example a million
times on my MacBook. These can give a <strong>general</strong> sense of the relative efficiency of each method</em>.</p>

<p>The easiest, most efficient way to concat strings is by using adjacent string literals:</p>

<pre><code>.041 seconds
String a = "hello, " "world!";
</code></pre>

<p>This still works if the adjacent strings are on different lines:</p>

<pre><code>.040 seconds
String b = "hello, "
    'world!';
</code></pre>

<p>Dart also has a <code>StringBuffer</code> class, and this can be used to build up a <code>StringBuffer</code> object
and convert it to a string by calling <code>toString()</code> on it:</p>

<pre><code>.689 seconds
var sb = new StringBuffer();
["hello, ", "world!"].forEach((item) {
  sb.add(item);
  });
String c = sb.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Strings</code> class (notice the plural) gives us 2 methods, <code>join()</code> and <code>concatAll()</code> that
can also be used. <code>Strings.join()</code> takes a delimiter as a second argument:</p>

<pre><code>.408 seconds
String d = Strings.join(["hello", "world!"], ", ");

.385 seconds
String e = Strings.concatAll(["hello", "world"]);
</code></pre>

<p>All of the above work, but if you are looking for a <code>+</code> substitute, use adjacent string literals;
if you need to join a list of strings using a delimiter,
use <code>Strings.join()</code>. If you plan on building a very long string, the
<code>StringBuffer</code> class can gather the components quite efficiently and convert them to a string only
when needed.</p>

<p>You can also use string interpolation; that will be the subject of my next post.</p>
