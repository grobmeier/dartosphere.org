<p>The Dart Editor and SDK was updated to version 0.7.5.3_r27776.  The most interesting new feature being the 'Deploy Polymer App' menu option as it shows Polymer.dart is clearly being adopted very quickly and WebUI being pushed out within just a few builds.</p> <p>Oreilly Media carried the article '<a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/09/build-reusable-widgets-for-the-web-with-polymer-and-dart.html">Build Reusable Widgets for the Web with Polymer and Dart</a>' by Seth Ladd. This step by step guide takes you through creating a control with autocomplete.</p>  <p>The Dart community is growing with Dartisans having 3100+ members and StackOverflow having 1500 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart/info">Dart Questions</a>.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sgzSw8DWgw4/Ukcum0-paGI/AAAAAAAAtSQ/sCgscnODKFg/s1600/emily+copy.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sgzSw8DWgw4/Ukcum0-paGI/AAAAAAAAtSQ/sCgscnODKFg/s320/emily+copy.png" /></a></div> <p>Dart engineer Emily Fortuna (pictured!) presents at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattle-gdg/events/125948972/">Seattle GDG Devfest</a>, Sept 28. <i>"Dev Fest is an all-day event for you to learn new Google technologies."</i></p> <p>In case you missed it, this blog carried the post '<a href="http://divingintodart.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/top-5-live-websites-already-using-dart.html">Top 5 Live Websites Already Using The Dart Language</a>' which has turned out to be the most popular post on this blog so far!
