<p>We continue our adventures in Dart and Canvas, with the Starr Rose. This mesh is named after its creator mathematician <a href="http://www3.amherst.edu/~nstarr/graphics.html">Norton Starr</a>. Of course, I am keeping it colourful and also adding an interactive element. Click on the canvas to draw a Rose - create an autumnal scene which is fitting as we reach the end of another summer.</p> <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2160v2b9FmQ/Ui-LcNtdpsI/AAAAAAAAsaY/ssRaCOlT6OE/s1600/starrrose.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2160v2b9FmQ/Ui-LcNtdpsI/AAAAAAAAsaY/ssRaCOlT6OE/s320/starrrose.png" /></a></p> <p>Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/diveintodart-polymer-dart-examples">GitHub</a> and the live demo is <a href="http://daftspaniel.com/dart/demo/polymerexamples/deploy/starrrose/rosestarr.html">here</a>. You may note that this is the first of the Diving Into Dart demo's to use Polymer. Also all Polymer demos will be linked into a single repository.</p>
