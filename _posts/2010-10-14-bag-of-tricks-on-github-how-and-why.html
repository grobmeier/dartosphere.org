<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://github.com/thinkpixellab/bot"><img title="bot2git" border="0" alt="bot2git" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3BkQqJvzLFM/TLc004ltJXI/AAAAAAAAKzM/Xfeh3OQfen4/bot2git%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="480" height="233"></a></p> <p>On October 7, I updated the <a href="http://bot.codeplex.com/">Bag of Tricks CodePlex site</a>:  <blockquote>Active development for BOT has moved to <a href="http://github.com/thinkpixellab/bot">GitHub</a>.</blockquote> <h1>Don’t Panic! (You can still use Subversion)</h1> <p>I’m super happy folks like using the BOT. I don’t want to stop you.</p> <p>You can still download the source as a zip. Just click download on the <a href="http://github.com/thinkpixellab/bot">GitHub page</a>.</p> <p>And you can still use Subversion (SVN). GitHub has done the wonderful work of enabling SVN via HTTP. Point <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise</a> (or your other favorite client) at <a title="http://svn.github.com/thinkpixellab/bot" href="http://svn.github.com/thinkpixellab/bot">http://svn.github.com/thinkpixellab/bot</a>. Super easy.</p> <h1>Reason: Git vs SVN</h1> <p>I could rant a long time, but I’ll just point you here: <a title="http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/#svn" href="http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/#svn">http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/#svn</a></p> <p>The short version:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Easy to work locally.</strong> Which is something you likely won’t comprehend until you do it. Saving a bunch of small changes locally before a big push to the server is really nice.  <li><strong>Easy to branch.</strong> On the server. Locally. It’s all easy. It’s all scary fast, too. No copying a bunch of identical files.  <li><strong>Scary fast.</strong> I can’t emphasize this enough. Wow. It’s just really fast. Everything. Pushing, Pulling, Committing, Branching. Amazing.</li></ul> <h1>Reason: GitHub vs CodePlex</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Faster.</strong> GitHub is just way faster. It probably has a lot to do with the benefits of Git.  <li><strong>Better Tools.</strong> Better for looking at changes, commenting on commits, etc.  <li><strong>Way less annoying.</strong> I frequently have crazy issues on CodePlex. Commits fail for weird reasons. Updates don’t update everything. I’m sick of it. Never had such problems on GitHub.</li></ul> <h1>Reason: Logistics</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Rails.</strong> I do a lot of work with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. The Rails universe is all on Git and GitHub.  <li><strong>I think in Git.</strong> It’s the tool I love. It’s the tool I use. I want to use it everywhere.  <li><strong>I live on GitHub.</strong> All of my projects – both open and closed – live on GitHub. I want to have one place to go.</li></ul> <h1>Jump on in. The Git is fine.</h1> <p>It’s more than fine. It’s awesome.</p>
