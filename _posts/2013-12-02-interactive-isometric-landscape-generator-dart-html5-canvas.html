<p>Landscape generation has always got my attention - starting with fault line graphics generation back on the 8-bit Dragon 32. That required some patience! I have spend a good deal of hobby computer time on various GFX experiments. OpenGL rather makes my non-maths brain hurt so I've settled for various pseudo 3d projections.
