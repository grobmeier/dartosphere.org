<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Getting Familiar with IO</span><br /><br />I have been checking out what is new with Dart for some time now, and I was quite interested to see that they released a formal library for IO. The server side is where a lot of my interest is for Dart, so I was anxious to try out some of the API.<br /><br />As I became familiar with IO, I noticed that there was quite a bit of async calls happening. The testing I had coded up to this point was all synchronous calls, so I looked into support for async.<br /><br />It turns out that there is a method called asyncTest that can be used. I have put together a 5 part presentation that illustrates how you can test async method calls.<br /><br />The scenario for this post is based on a library I am coding now that is targeted as an add-on library to the existing http library that I retrieved from the bleeding edge repo. From spending time trying to learn Node.js, I decided that my library would be based on a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;library in Node called 'Formidable'. I originally attempted to port their Node.js library, but decided that eventually that it would be a good learning experience to follow their API, but provide my own Dart based implementation.<br /><br />I am not finished the library (almost), but I wanted to show you how I did some of my testing early on. Here are the 5 parts;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/6837eCe9AKcY" target="_blank">Part 1</a><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/ADNgV7xTp" target="_blank">Part 2</a><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/FZKZGwawP" target="_blank">Part 3</a><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/oiJBi7qd" target="_blank">Part 4</a><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/xElv6eBL" target="_blank">Part 5</a><br /><br />The GitHub repository for this project is <a href="https://github.com/iggymacd/DartMultipartTest" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />I will be releasing the library very soon, but in the meantime, you can get started testing your async calls.<br />
