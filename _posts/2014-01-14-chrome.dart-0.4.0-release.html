<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde?tab=members">dart-gde</a> has updated the <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart">chrome.dart</a> to &#8216;0.4.0&#8217;. This release contains a whole rewrite of the project. All APIs are now generated from chrome apps/ext <a href="https://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/api">IDLs</a>. Most unit tests from previous <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart">chrome.dart</a> have been ported.</p>

<h2>About chrome.dart</h2>

<p><a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/chrome">chrome.dart</a> package provides the generated APIs to access chrome <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html">apps &amp; extensions</a> through dart interfaces. The APIs depend on the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/js-interop">js-interop</a> to communicate with the javascript vm for accessing the APIs. Currently no native interfaces exist between dart vm and chrome browser. In a later point in time those interfaces will exist, for now this provides a way to access those interfaces.</p>

<h2>chrome_gen.dart -> chrome.dart</h2>

<p>At first <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome_gen.dart">chrome_gen.dart</a> was the project that kicked off moving to generated APIs. It was getting frustrating having to hand write, maintain and test <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/chrome">chrome.dart</a>. We did avoid looking into generation from IDL, because the IDL in the chromium is in two different formats <a href="https://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/api">json &amp; chrome specific WebIDL</a>. The nice part about the original <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart">chrome.dart</a> package is we could introduce more structure for the APIs then what the generated javascript APIs looked like. So after initial development by <a href="https://github.com/devoncarew/">Devon Carew</a>, we decided it was a better direction to use <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/tree/master/tool">parsers and generators</a> to create and maintain the APIs. Four months later we had a 90% complete package that was already being used by a few projects, including <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/spark">spark</a>. We are able to generate enough structure to keep nice APIs and generate form the IDL, this was a win for the project.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The API documentation is automatically generated for <a href="http://dart-gde.github.io/chrome.dart/app/">Apps</a> and <a href="http://dart-gde.github.io/chrome.dart/ext/">Extensions</a> on each check in. A few wiki pages exist and we are in the process of migrating them from <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome_gen.dart/wiki">chrome_gen.dart wiki</a> -> <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/wiki">chrome.dart wiki</a>. We do need help and welcome pull requests and wiki edits.</p>

<h2>Samples</h2>

<p>Currently the best source of project setup exists with <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/tree/master/app">app</a> in the project. The <code>app</code> folder in a dart project will not have the automatic symlinks generated by <code>pub</code>. That helps out greatly since it would pollute our folder structure and cause bad things to happen. Instead we have a simple <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/blob/master/bin/setup_app.dart">setup_app.dart</a> script that helps build and copy packages over to the <code>app</code> folder. Right now its specific for the <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart">chrome.dart</a> project but should be easy to replicate for your own chrome apps or extensions. Another neat script which is mac specific but could be generalized is <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/blob/master/bin/load_app.sh">load_app.sh</a>. <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/blob/master/bin/load_app.sh">load_app.sh</a> shows a simple way to load up an application in <code>app</code> folder from command line.</p>

<h2>Helping out</h2>

<p>We still need more unit tests, documentation, and additional development. If your interested checkout the <a href="https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/issues?state=open">github issues</a> or send pull requests.</p>
