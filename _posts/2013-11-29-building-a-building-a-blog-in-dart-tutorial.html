Almost every web application server framework out there has a “How to Build a Blog in X Minutes” tutorial. It's a right of passage for any self-respecting framework, from veterans like Ruby on Rails and Django, to the newer node.js-based frameworks.<br /><br />Dart is no exception. Or... is it? A search for "building a blog in Dart" returns quite a few blogs <i>about</i>&nbsp;Dart, but none about blogs <i>in</i>&nbsp;Dart. Why?<br /><br />Well, few people seem to know that Dart includes a <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart-vm.html" target="_blank">standalone VM</a> with a built-in <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/dart_io/HttpServer.html" target="_blank">HTTP server</a>, making the VM a very node.js like environment in many ways (though if you like Dart, with a nicer language and libraries). Also, Dart doesn't have any popular, high-level, web server frameworks yet. Some frameworks in other languages are so high-level that you can practically type "superframework new blog" and be finished. Dart has a few libraries that help, but for the most part we have to handle requests, serve files, connect to databases, etc. on or own.<br /><br />This means that a Dart blog tutorial will be longer and more complex - and maybe less "impressive" to some at a glance - but it's also a great opportunity to teach many parts of the Dart stack and ecosystem.<br /><h2>Let's build one!</h2>Over the course of a few, or many, posts I'm going to explore all the steps and choices needed to build a fairly simple blog platform in Dart. Since I haven’t actually built a blog in Dart yet (no, I haven't done everything ahead of time before this post) we'll all be on a journey as we either build up, or find, the necessary pieces.<br /><br />We won't go for extreme brevity here - I'm sure that will be covered by others as more frameworks pop up - instead we'll cover a basic function, like serving a file, and accomplish it&nbsp;first&nbsp;with little-to-no assistance from high-level packages, and then use, or build own own, helpers and abstractions to make things easier. Maybe when we're done we'll have a a tidy 5-minute tutorial, but the journey will meander a bit more.<br /><h2>Choices, Choices</h2>Since Dart is so new, there are many, many choices of approaches to take and packages and libraries that might help us out. Just the choices off the top of my head are plenty:<br /><br /><ul><li>Server or client side rendering?</li><li>Single page app?</li><li>What UI framework?</li><li>Which database and client library?</li><li>ORM, do we need one?</li><li>Serialization, how does it work?</li></ul><br />Some of these choices I'll make later, but a few I'll settle up front since I roughly know what I want to build. Dart is designed to be a great language for building modern complex web applications, I’ll go with a single-page app, rendered on the client with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/" target="_blank">custom elements</a>&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/polymer-dart/" target="_blank">Polymer.dart</a>, with all the data served up AJAX-style serialized as JSON. This means we won't just have a blog tutorial, but hopefully an exercise in building a modern full-stack app all in Dart.<br /><h2>Step 1: Stay Tuned...</h2><div>Tomorrow I'll start with Step 1, which will cover the very basics of starting an HTTP server and serving an HTML file to the browser. Then we'll move on to data modeling and persistence.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I actually have any readers, and you have suggestions, questions or thing you'd like to see covered, please let me know.</div>
