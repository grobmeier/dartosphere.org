Google I/O was a blast, and <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/05/strong-dart-presence-at-2013-google-io.html">Dart had a great time</a>. For posterity, check out the video of my talk with co-presenter Justin Fagnani. We covered what's new across the Dartosphere, including language features, libraries, tools, and ecosystem.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvZTOCAG_-0" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Like what you see?
