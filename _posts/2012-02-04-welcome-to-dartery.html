I'm Justin and this is where I'm going to&nbsp;</span>chronicle<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;my adventures in <a href="http://dartlang.org/" target="_blank">Dart</a> land.</span><br /><div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dartlang.org/imgs/dart-logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://www.dartlang.org/imgs/dart-logo.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I doubt anyone visiting this site won't know already, but Dart is a new programming language project started by my employer - Google - with the goal of making web development much better for large projects and large teams.</div><div><div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Dart is in it's very early stages and there's still a lot of work to be done, a lot of code to be written, and a lot of patterns, best practices and idioms to figure out. That makes things fairly exciting, and increases the need for Darters to share their experiences to each other and the Dart team, and that's exactly my goal with this blog.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bna-art.s3.amazonaws.com/www.bootsnall.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BnA-Beer-Darts.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://bna-art.s3.amazonaws.com/www.bootsnall.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BnA-Beer-Darts.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Picture based on true events.<br />Beer not required for optimal Dart programming, but may come in handy.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">I'm not much of a blogger or public writer, and (unfortunately) I also don't write Dart as part of my fulltime job, so I don't have a lot of time to hack on Dart, but I'll try to throw up my thoughts and experiences here&nbsp;</span>occasionally<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;with the hope that someone out there finds it useful.</span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Happy Darting!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; -Justin</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div></div></div>
