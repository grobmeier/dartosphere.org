The Dart Editor and SDK was updated to version 0.7.6_r28018. There's a number of new features for the Editor - REPL in Dartium, a new HTML/CSS editor, faster dart2js and new Polymer.dart samples. The official Dart site has a good <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/10/faster-dart2js-and-new-html-editor-in.html">round-up</a> of the features with graphs &amp; screenshots.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ksU9ukJiWYg/UlBMZCz8oLI/AAAAAAAAthM/UWaNnrOuIKo/s1600/pathfind.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="178" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ksU9ukJiWYg/UlBMZCz8oLI/AAAAAAAAthM/UWaNnrOuIKo/s200/pathfind.png" width="200" /></a></div><div>And whilst you are over at DartLang.org, you should cast an eye over this article <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/articles/event-loop/">The Event Loop and Dart</a>. It does get a little confusing with a few notes on Dart bugs that complicate things but there's key Dart concepts here.</div> <div>If you are feeling a little lost, Seth Ladd's <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SethLadd/posts/jgArcy5wEvV">Path Finder example</a> might get you back on the right track! As usual the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sethladd/dart-a-star">GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><br />The Polymer.dart revolution continues but there was an important clarification on the mailing list re:WebUI support: <pre style="margin-left: 60px;"><i>One thing to keep in mind is that Web UI is still maintained. We're not adding new features, but we're ensuring it still works.</i><br /></pre>See <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/web-ui/V66biNm0mi4/k7D5ovDQjGsJ">here</a> for the full post on Google Groups. </div> <br /> <div>This resource doesn't seem new but I stumbled across it for the first time this week and bookmarked it quickly. <a href="http://synonym.dartlang.org/">synonym.dartlang.org</a> gives Dart Code examples and there equivalents in Python, Javascript and C#.</div> <br /> <div>That's it for this editon of TWID. Build something great with Dart in the week ahead!</div>
