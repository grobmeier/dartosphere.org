All I can say is, wow!<br /><br />First of all, I wasn't even on the agenda.  In fact, the room I was using wasn't really even labelled on the map--it took me several minutes to find it.  It was a small room.  2 minutes before my talk was supposed to start, I only had 3 people in the audience.  However, 10 minutes later, every seat was taken, and people were standing at the back and along the sides.  The room was packed!<br /><br />Since Dart is so new, we haven't spoken about it at very many places.  I told the Egyptians that I was giving them a chance to become the best Dart programmers in the world because they were seeing the talk before most of the rest of the world had seen it.  I almost got a standing ovation ;)<br /><br />People were very excited about Dart and asked a ton of excellent questions.  Even after my talk, I had to stand around for 2.5 hours answering more questions.<br /><br />The comments on Google+ were very supportive:<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/103481739165478403084/posts">Hady Allam</a> said, "your DART session is one of the best sessions i have ever attended. Thank You +Shannon Behrens and hope to see you again in Egypt."<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/103684318952941443174">Abdurrahman Alraies</a> said, "The dart session was the best surprise of the day.  Thank you very much +Shannon Behrens and +Sebastian Trzcinski-Cl√©ment It says much about how important is Egypt to Google."<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/117478487445951455805">Saied Attala</a> said, "really i have opened the comment box for 30 minutes and can't write every thing for you.  i loved your Dart sessions and your sense of humor.  i enjoyed talking with you and having pics with you."<br /><br />Those comments were very touching to me.  To all the Egyptians out there who went to my Dart talk, thank you for making me feel so special!  I hope I get to come back to Egypt again!<br /><br />After the trip, I accidentally ran into <a href="https://plus.google.com/117369940038227331789/posts">Lars Bak</a>, the creator of Dart, in Zurich.  That was very exciting for me!<br /><br />If you're interested, here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_Z56A18VRlxYjU4NzQ4YmEtMDdmNi00YzU1LTlhYjEtYWE1ZWZjZWYyMmYz&hl=en_US">slides</a>.<br /><br />Thanks also to <a href="https://plus.google.com/117478487445951455805/posts">Saied Attala</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/100965599294063024961/posts">Ayman Reda Bedair</a> for the pictures and <a href="https://plus.google.com/118397406534237711570/posts">Seth Ladd</a> for most of the slides.
