## Learning Dart

A book written by Dzenan Ridjanovic and Ivo Balbaert.

Packt Publishing released a new book on Dart, called "Learning Dart".
Both - Ivo and Dzenan - are Dartisans from hour one and experienced authors too. They are
also running a <a href="http://www.learningdart.org">great website for the book</a>.

The authors wrote around 360 pages packed with interesting content to get you started with
Dart. They start to cover language basics and even object-orientation basics but quickly
head on to more interesting chapters like building models, forms, animation or how to
develop business applications with dartlang.

One of the chapters which many of the readers will be interested in are
the pages about DOM manipulation. Actually this chapter is packed with lots of information.
After reading it, you'll be ready to kick off. However "Learning Dart" expects
you know what DOM is and also what CSS is. The examples are pretty interesting:
in chapter 5 you are writing a ping-pong game.

Unfortunately it is not exactly less code
to write for such a game and so you have sometimes to read through quite a couple of lines.
The biggest source listing had more than four pages. The authors are explaining
what they do but honestly it's not that easy to follow.
There are markers in the code available which serve as reference points from the text.
This is not enough for me as those markers are sometimes hard to spot. In the text markers
are called "line numbers", but there are not line numbers which added to the confusion.

This is something I have expected the editors of PacktPub would have found.
Actually this is permanent issue with this book:
The overall readability could be improved with more work on the formatting.
Source code could be organized better, line numbers would help and
sometimes even the indentation is wrong. Also I dislike the type setting.

While we are at it, I found the code style was inconsistent. Sometimes
one liners are having curly brackets, sometimes not. Sometimes a method
is camel-cased, sometimes words are separated by underscore. Good editors
should find that stuff and report.

But back to the book.

The good thing is authors do not stop with the "included batteries" of Dart itself but
show what frameworks are being useful and available. In example you'll read what
MVC/UI are available and what you can do with them. Although the individual descriptions
are very short you'll find enough information to dig into the right frameworks
for your current job. As a busy developer you'll will clearly appreciate the
birds eyes perspective here.

The content of writing games is surely interesting, but the authors
didn't forget that most of us are the nice developer from the next corner and
we often don't write games. We write business applications for our Boss.

In example, the authors showed how to validate form data. They first start
with how it is done with HTML5, which I think could have been cut off.
However they show how one can validate in two different ways. For some reason
I felt there should be a more elegant way to do it. The book gave me
a good start, but then I felt I had to find the perfect solution on my own.

"Learning Dart" covers databases. This is great news, as direct access
to databases like MySQL were not well-known before. The book shows whats
available and then moves on to explain how to deal with MySQL. The chapter
actually comes with a lot of code as well. If you are a little patient
and willing to try to understand by yourself, you should be settled.
In addition, the book covers MongoDB which I didn't read as I am more into
CouchDB.

### Conclusion

The book covers a lot of material and is pretty much good for anybody
who really wants to dig deep into Dart. However the PacktPub editors
didn't do their job very well. The general formatting is sometimes
pretty tough to read. A few glitches here and there which should have
been identified took away some fun from reading it. If the editors
would have reported these issues, the book would be much, much better.
But well, we are developers and for that reason we maybe can live
with that.

The content itself is interesting and shows quite a couple of great things.
While the book's title is "Learning Dart" it's not a book focused
on the language itself. It's a book covering many aspects to
learn to use Dart for daily programming. You should not be a total
programming newbie to read this book.

After all, I think one needs some patience with this book. If you focus
on the content you'll be happy; if you love Shakespeare and do programming
only in prime time you might not like it very much.

There were two very competent programmers writing this book and they
give you a lot of inspiration. With the right editing, this would
have been a great book. Now I need to take away a few points - unfortunately.
